The report needs to be written as a two-column IEEE standard paper.
There will be a template on Canvas with LaTeX code with all sections. If
you do not like using LaTeX, you can create the same style in Word or
Google Docs. All images need to be labeled as figures and numbered. There
should be absolutely no hand-drawn or handwritten elements of the paper.
All figures should be clear and look professional. All citations need to be
done using IEEE standard format.
